Welcome to the Indiana 50501 Veterans website.  50501 is a distributed protest organization that aims to make people aware of the problems currently plaguing America.  

Indiana 50501 Veterans is a sub group of Indiana 50501 focused on the issues and concerns plaguing veterans.  

We protest alongside Indiana 50501 but we have our own distinct identity, website and event dates and we are aligned with the National 50501 Veterans group.

## <a name="faq"></a> FAQ

### Q: What is 50501 and why should a veteran care?

#### A: 50501 grew from the grassroots upward to every State in the Union - 50501 means 50 States 50 Protests 1 day.  It is centrally coordinated but decentrally executed at the state levels.   

### Q: Who are you and why should I care?

#### A: I'm just a Veteran who cares about you.  I served full-time for 30 years in the USAF.  I'm not a combat Veteran and never had the opportunity to deploy, but I served our country as a Systems Acquisition Officer, and overseas as an Aircraft and Munitions Maintenance Officer, among other duties.  I worked to ensure our men and women in combat roles had the best, most advanced and most sustainable equipment available to execute their mission.  I am proud to have served alongside our professional and highly capable civillian/federal employees during my career.  I swore an oath to support and defend the Constitution - I still believe that as do most if not all Veterans.  I belive in preserving our democracy and supporting all Veterans, especially those marginalized and suffering from mental, physical and emotional trauma due to their service.  We must never forget those who have gone before us, those who served with us and those willing to carry the torch of liberty in the future. 

### Q: I served in the Army (Navy, USMC, USCG, etc.) and you are Air Force, why should I care?

#### A: We are all brothers and sisters in arms.  During my career I served in support of the joint community as well the USAF.  I was assigned to United States Special Operations Command and finished my career in charge of the USAF CV-22 Osprey working along-side my USMC and USN counterparts as one coordinated team. We are always a Joint Team; training, planning and executing the Joint fight. 

### Q: What are you trying to accomplish?

#### A: For Veterans and Civillians -- Visability, two-way Communications, A Call to Action, and to push back against an out of control regime that is punching down on its citizens.
